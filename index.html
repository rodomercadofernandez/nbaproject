        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>In this report, we delve into two intriguing questions through data analysis. Our first query seeks to uncover the average age of players on NBA teams, 
            shedding light on the dynamics of youth and experience within the league. The second question delves into the financial aspect, as we aim to identify the 
            top 5 most expensive NBA teams, thus unraveling the intriguing world of team valuations. The pursuit of 
            these insights is driven by a thirst for knowledge, a quest to understand the fascinating intricacies of the NBA, and the valuable lessons it can offer.</p>

        <h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
        <p>As a conclusion regarding the first question about the average age of teams, we find that the Utah Jazz has the youngest average age, while the San Antonio Spurs have the highest average age. One possible interpretation of this is that, even though both teams compete in the same league, they have different aspirations and objectives. The Spurs, in their pursuit of winning the championship, place a greater emphasis on experience, while the Utah Jazz focuses on promoting young players with the
             intention of potentially selling them to more powerful teams and generating economic benefits to continue growing as an institution.</p>
             <p>     </p>
        <p>As for the second question, it's evident that the Cleveland Cavaliers have the highest budget in the league, indicating that they have significant financial resources to pursue a championship.</p>
